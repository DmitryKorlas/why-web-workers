    <h1>Why Web Workers</h1>
    <p class="summary">This page demonstrates a reason of usage Web Workers. You see a simple animated element.
        And two buttons for running the same task. Is does not matter what the task exactly do, let's say it's
        heavy operation from the time point of view. So, if we start this task it will cause to freeze the page and
        makes it unresponsive for a moment. UI Developers should care about UI response time. So, when you have such
        situation in your application, it's better to delegate it to backend/API. But if you still need to do it on UI
        you can run such tasks inside web worker. Web worker will not freeze UI because code will be executed on the
        separate thread. Try the example to see the difference. See more information on official
